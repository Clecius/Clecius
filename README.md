I love to code and I've been doing this for over 25 years. C/C++ fanatic and Python lover, but I've already worked professionally with several other languages, like Pascal, Assembler, Clipper, COBOL, Fortran, Visual Basic, AMOS, Delphi, Tcl, PL/SQL, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, C#, Go and some others. Professionally I have performed activities such as Systems Analysis, Database Administrator, IT Administrator and Development Leadership.

As a hobbyist I like to evolve my game development knowledge, work with leather and cultivate plants.

God be praised!
